As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information. An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

The user will be able to:

Sort the table by Name

Filter the users by searching through first name
